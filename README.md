# Analyzing-clustering-with-pyspark
2 Famous algorithms called Kmeans and Kmeans++ are analyzed with pyspark without any libraries.

## introduction:-
Imagine you are a doctor and wanted a machine that would classify very precise patients into crictical state, emergency state and normal state . Or if you wanted to check plagiarism in the homework of students in your university. If you go on thinking scenarios, there will be millions of million cases where there would be need of grouping items based on similarities.
**Clustering** is one of the powerful methods that falls in this category of grouping of objects based on similarites. As clustering is one of the important techniques in today's world ,therefore this project explores two powerful clustering algorithms called kmeans and kmeans++ using pyspark without any inbuilt libraries.

## Methodolgy :-
1. First and foremost thing is finding k centroids. This is the only step in which kmeans and kmeans++ differ and it is as follows:-
|kmeans|kmeans++|
